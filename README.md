# Lib Auth Middleware

This repository contains an authorization middleware for the Fiber framework in Go, allowing you to check if a user is authorized to perform a specific action on a resource. The middleware sends a POST request to an authorization service, passing the user's details, resource, and desired action.

Repository: [lib-auth](https://github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Set the needed environment variables:

In your environment configuration or `.env` file, set the following environment variables:

```dotenv
PLUGIN_AUTH_ADDRESS=http://localhost:4000
PLUGIN_AUTH_ENABLED=true
```

### 2. Create a new instance of the middleware:

In your `config.go` file, configure the environment variables for the Auth Service:

```go
type Config struct {
    Address             string `env:"PLUGIN_AUTH_ADDRESS"`
    Enabled             bool   `env:"PLUGIN_AUTH_ENABLED"`
}

cfg := &Config{}

logger := zap.InitializeLogger()
```

```go
import "github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth/middleware"

authClient := middleware.NewAuthClient(cfg.Address, cfg.Enabled, logger)
```

### 2. Use the middleware in your Fiber application:

```go
func NewRoutes(auth *authMiddleware.AuthClient, [...]) *fiber.App {
    f := fiber.New(fiber.Config{
        DisableStartupMessage: true,
    })
    
    applicationName := os.Getenv("APPLICATION_NAME")
    
    // Applications routes
    f.Get("/v1/applications", auth.Authorize(applicationName, "ledger", "get"), applicationHandler.GetApplications)
}
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

The `Authorize` function:

* Receives the `sub` (user), `resource` (resource), and `action` (desired action).
* Sends a POST request to the authorization service.
* Checks if the response indicates that the user is authorized.
* Allows the normal application flow or returns a 403 (Forbidden) error.

## 📥 Example Request to Auth

```http
POST /v1/authorize
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here

{
    "sub":      "lerian/userId",
    "resource": "resourceName",
    "action":   "read"
}
```

## 📡 Expected Authorization Service Response

The authorization service should return a JSON response in the following format:

```json
{
    "authorized": true,
    "timestamp": "2025-03-03T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## 🚧 Error Handling

The middleware captures and logs the following error types:

* Failure to create the request
* Failure to send the request
* Failure to read the response body
* Failure to deserialize the response JSON
* Errors from the authorization service (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden)
